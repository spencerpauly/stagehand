`extract()` grabs structured text from the current page using [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). Given instructions and `schema`, you will receive structured data.

### `extract` a single object

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a single object:
```javascript
  const item = await page.extract({
    instruction: "extract the price of the item",
    schema: z.object({
      price: z.number(),
    }),
  });

```
Your output schema will look like:
```
{ price: number }
```

### `extract` a link
<Note>To extract links or URLs, the relevant field in your schema needs to be defined using `z.string().url()`. See the snippet below: </Note>

Here is how an `extract` call might look for extracting a link or URL.
```javascript
  const extraction = await stagehand.page.extract({
    instruction: "extract the link to the 'contact us' page",
    schema: z.object({
      link: z.string().url(),
    }),
  });

  console.log("the link to the contact us page is: ", extraction.link);
```


### `extract` a list of objects

Here is how an `extract` call might look for a list of objects. Note that you need to wrap the `z.array` in an outer `z.object`.
```javascript
  const apartments = await stagehand.page.extract({
    instruction:
      "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet."
    schema: z.object({
      list_of_apartments: z.array(
        z.object({
          address: z.string(),
          price: z.string(),
          square_feet: z.string(),
        }),
      ),
    }}
  })

  console.log("the apartment data is: ", apartments));
```

Your output schema will look like:
```
  list_of_apartments: [
      {
        address: "street address here",
        price: "$1234.00",
        square_feet: "700"
      },
      {
         address: "another address here",
         price: "1010.00",
         square_feet: "500"
      },
      .
      .
      .
  ]
```

<Tip>To provide some additional context at the field level within your schema, you can use `.describe()`. See the snippet below: </Tip>

```javascript
const apartments = await stagehand.page.extract({
 instruction:
   "Extract ALL the apartment listings and their details, including address, price, and square feet."
 schema: z.object({
   list_of_apartments: z.array(
     z.object({
       address: z.string().describe("the address of the apartment"),
       price: z.string().describe("the price of the apartment"),
       square_feet: z.string().describe("the square footage of the apartment"),
     }),
   ),
 }}
})
```

### **Arguments:** [`ExtractOptions<T extends z.AnyZodObject>`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/types/stagehand.ts)

  <ParamField path="instruction" type="string" required>
    Provides instructions for extraction
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="schema" type="z.AnyZodObject" required>
    Defines the structure of the data to extract
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="useTextExtract" type="boolean" deprecated>
    This field is now **deprecated** and has no effect.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="selector" type="string" optional>
      An xpath that can be used to reduce the scope of an extraction. If an xpath is passed in, `extract` will only process
      the contents of the HTML element that the xpath points to. Useful for reducing input tokens and increasing extraction
      accuracy.
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="modelName" type="AvailableModel" optional>
    Specifies the model to use
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="modelClientOptions" type="object" optional>
    Configuration options for the model client. See [`ClientOptions`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/types/model.ts).
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="domSettleTimeoutMs" type="number" optional>
    Timeout in milliseconds for waiting for the DOM to settle
  </ParamField>

### **Returns:** [`Promise<ExtractResult<T extends z.AnyZodObject>>`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/types/stagehand.ts)

Resolves to the structured data as defined by the provided `schema`.
