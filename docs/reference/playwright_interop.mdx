Stagehand is built on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), so you can use Playwright methods directly through the Stagehand instance.

## `page` and `context`

`stagehand.page` and `stagehand.context` are instances of Playwright's `Page` and `BrowserContext` respectively. Use these methods to interact with the Playwright instance that Stagehand is using.

```javascript
const page = stagehand.page;
// Base Playwright methods work
await page.goto("https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand");

// Stagehand overrides Playwright objects
await page.act({
	action: "click on the contributors"
})
```
