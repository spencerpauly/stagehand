  We've created a Github repository with plenty of ready-to-run guides for Stagehand, including persistent contexts and deploying to Vercel.

## Next.js + Vercel

Check out the [Next.js + Vercel example](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand-nextjs-quickstart) to see how to build a Next.js app and one-click deploy it to Vercel.

## Custom LLM Clients

```bash
# For Vercel AI SDK
npx create-browser-app --example custom-client-aisdk

# For Ollama
npx create-browser-app --example custom-client-ollama
```

This example shows how to use a custom LLM client in Stagehand. We have working examples for [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) and [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/). This helps you use your own LLM client in Stagehand if you don't want to use 4o/Sonnet.

This helps you connect to LLMs like DeepSeek, Llama, Perplexity, Groq, and more!

## Persistent Contexts

```bash
npx create-browser-app --example persist-context
```

This example uses Browserbase's context persistence to create a persistent context that can be used across multiple runs. 

This is really useful for automating on sites that require login, or for automating on sites that have a captcha. Once you've logged in, you can use the same context to automate on the same site without having to log in again.

## Deploying to Vercel

```bash
npx create-browser-app --example deploy-vercel
```

This example creates a scaffolded Vercel function that can easily be deployed to Vercel with `npx vercel deploy`.

It creates a `GET` endpoint at `/api/stagehand` that can be used to run Stagehand script in `index.ts`.
