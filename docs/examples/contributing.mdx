Special thanks to [Jeremy Press](https://github.com/jeremypress), [Navid Pour](https://github.com/navidkpr), and [all the contributors](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/graphs/contributors) for your help in making Stagehand the best browser automation framework.

## General Workflow

Get listed as [one of our beloved contributors](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/graphs/contributors)!

1. **Discuss your proposed contribution before starting.** Not doing this runs you the risk of entirely discarding something you put considerable time and effort into. You can DM Anirudh on [Slack](https://stagehand.dev/slack) for a 1on1 call.
2. **Open a Pull Request.** Create a fork of this repository, and follow [GitHub’s instructions to create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). This allows our team to review your contribution and leave comments. 
3. **Wait for Review**. We’ll do our best to get to your contribution as soon as possible. If it’s been 2-3 days and you have yet to receive any comments, DM Anirudh on [Slack](https://stagehand.dev/slack)
4. **Merge into `evals` branch.** We don’t let external contributors [run our CI via GitHub Actions](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) to prevent spam and misuse. If your contribution passes an initial screen, we’ll run our evals on it
    1. By default, all PRs run the following tests that you can also run from the repo source:
        1. Lint (`npm run lint`) - Runs `prettier` and `eslint`. If this fails, you can most likely run `npm run format` to fix some simple linting errors.
        2. Build (`npm run build`) - Lints and builds TS → JS in `dist/` via `tsup`
        3. End-to-End (`npm run e2e`) - These are deterministic end-to-end Playwright tests to ensure the integrity of basic Playwright functionality of [`stagehand.page`](http://stagehand.page) and `stagehand.context` as well as compatibility with the Browserbase API
        4. Combination (`npm run evals category combination`) - This runs AI-based end-to-end tests using combinations of `act`, `extract`, and `observe` 
    2. If you’re changing anything about `act`, `extract`, or `observe` itself, we might also run specific act/extract/observe evals to ensure existing functionality doesn’t significantly drop.

5. **Cleanup and merge to main**. Once it’s in `evals`, unfortunately the original contributor can’t make any further changes. The internal Stagehand team will be responsible for cleaning up the code and bringing it into main. 

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Use draft PRs.** If your PR is a work in progress, please convert it to a draft (see below) while you’re working on it, and mark it for review/add reviewers when you’re ready. This helps us prevent clutter in the review queue.

2. **Provide a reproducible test plan.** Include an eval (preferred) or example. We can’t merge your PR if we can’t run anything that specifically highlights your contribution. 
    1. Write a script in [`evals/tasks`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/tree/main/evals/tasks) as `someTask.ts` 
    2. Add your script to [`evals.config.json`](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand/blob/main/evals/evals.config.json) with default category `combination` (*or act/extract/observe if you’re* *only* *testing* *act/extract/observe*).
3. **Add a changeset.** Run `npx changeset` to add a changeset that will directly reflect in the `CHANGELOG` in the upcoming release.
    1. `patch` - no net new functionality to an end-user
    2. `minor` - some net new functionality to an end-user (new function parameter, new exposed type, etc.)
    3. `major` - you shouldn’t be committing a major change
