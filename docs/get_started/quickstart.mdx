You can use `npx create-browser-app` to get started in 1 minute. This will create a new project that will analyze the Stagehand docs using Stagehand.

<Tip>

We highly recommend using the Node.js runtime environment to run Stagehand scripts, as opposed to newer alternatives like Deno or Bun. 

**Bun does not support Stagehand** since it doesn't support [Playwright](https://github.com/search?q=repo:oven-sh/bun+playwright&type=issues).

</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">
   Before you begin, you'll need to install Node.js and NPM. We highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js versions, and running on Node version 20+.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new project">

You can use [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) to create a new project. You should have npx included with `npm`, the default package manager for Node.js. 

<Tabs>
	<Tab title="npm">
	```bash
	npx create-browser-app
	```
	</Tab>

	<Tab title="pnpm">
	```bash
	pnpm create browser-app
	```
	</Tab>

	<Tab title="yarn">
	```bash
	yarn create browser-app
	```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>


To use the pre-release version of Stagehand, run:

<Tabs>
	<Tab title="npm">
	```bash
	npx create-browser-app --alpha
	```
	</Tab>

	<Tab title="pnpm">
	```bash
	pnpm create browser-app --alpha
	```
	</Tab>

	<Tab title="yarn">
	```bash
	yarn create browser-app --alpha
	```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

It will ask you the following questions:
```
✔ What is the name of your project? my-app
✔ Would you like to start with a quickstart example? Yes
✔ Select AI model: Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet
✔ Run locally or on Browserbase? Local
✔ Run browser in headless mode (hide Chromium popup)?  No
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies and run the script">
<Tabs>
	<Tab title="npm">
	```bash
	cd my-app
	npm install
	npm run start
	```
	</Tab>

	<Tab title="pnpm">
	```bash
	cd my-app
	pnpm install
	pnpm run start
	```
	</Tab>

	<Tab title="yarn">
	```bash
	cd my-app
	yarn install
	yarn start
	```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

Use the package manager of your choice to install the dependencies. We also have a `postinstall` script that will automatically install the Playwright browser with `playwright install`.
